comment: 
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: I handle requests for an OpenID server.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: Some types of requests (those which are not checkid requests) may be handed to my handleRequest method, and I will take care of it and return a response.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: For your convenience, I also provide an interface to Decoder.decode and SigningEncoder.encode through my methods decodeRequest and encodeResponse.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: All my state is encapsulated in an store, which means I'm not generally pickleable but I am easy to reconstruct.
