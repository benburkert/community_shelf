  body: "Implementer's note: In a more symmetric client/server implementation, there would be more types of #OpenIDResponse object and they would have validated attributes according to the type of response. But as it is, Response objects in a server are basically write-only, their only job is to go out over the wire, so this is just a loose wrapper around #OpenIDResponse.fields."
