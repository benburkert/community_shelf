- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: Take a list of basic filters and makes a filter that transforms the basic filter into a top-level filter. This is mostly useful for the implementation of make_filter, which should only be needed for special cases or internal use by this library.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: This object is useful for creating simple filters for services that use one URI and are specified by one Type (we expect most Types will fit this paradigm).
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: Creates a BasicServiceEndpoint object and apply the filter functions to it until one of them returns a value.
